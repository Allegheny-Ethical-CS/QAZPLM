# Accompanying Questions

This document contains a number of questions that could accompany the project, allowing users to look deeper into real issues.

- How can the inferences made by larger scale algorithms (such as advertisement, search engine, and social media algorithms) be harmful? What biases do they display?
- Was the handedness decision rendered by the program correct? If you ran it multiple times did you get different handedness predictions?
- If the handedness decision rendered by the program was incorrect, why do you think it was incorrect? After thinking about this on a smaller scale, why do you think many larger scale inferencing algorithms are incorrect?
- Can you think of any behavioral, personality, or experience traits that influenced your results or that could influence the results of other users?
- Did you have any individual trials, for instance one trial that is all on the left side, that skewed your total results?
- Are there any crazy outliers within the class data you noticed during your analysis?
