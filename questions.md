# Accompanying Questions

This document contains a number of questions that could accompany the project, allowing users to look deeper into real issues.

- How can the inferences made by larger scale algorithms (such as advertisement, search engine, and social media algorithms) be harmful? What biases do they display?
- Was the handedness decision rendered by the program correct? If you ran it multiple times did you get different handedness predictions?
- If the handedness decision rendered by the program was incorrect, why do you think it was incorrect? After thinking about this on a smaller scale, why do you think many larger scale inferencing algorithms are incorrect?
- Can you think of any behavioral, personality, or experience traits that influenced your results or that could influence the results of other users?
- Did you have any individual trials, for instance one trial that is all on the left side, that skewed your total results?
- Are there any crazy outliers within the class data you noticed during your analysis?

New Questions:
- What do you see when you run the program?
- Once you have ran the program and it's basic output, whats do you think is going on?
- How does your behavior influence the data of the program?
- How can you be profiled/tracked based on your online behaviour?
  - What happens if your data is used incorrectly, for say ad recommendations?
  - What are the implications associated with making incorrect biases?
  - Do you feel the government should make companies more liable for incorrectly using and tracking user data?
- Have you noticed any trials heavily skewed on one side of the keyboard that skew total results?
- On say mobile phones is hand bias a real thing? For instance, Instagrams polls always put the "Yes" option on the left side of the screen.
